# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025

## Overview

Scryfall OS ("we", "us", "our", "the Service") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our Magic: The Gathering card search service.

**Key Principles**:
- We do not require user accounts
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not use tracking cookies or analytics by default
- Search queries are not logged or stored
- We do not sell or share any user data

## Information We Do NOT Collect

To be absolutely clear, by default the Service does NOT collect:

- Personal identification information (name, email, address, etc.)
- User account information (we don't have accounts)
- Search history or query logs
- Browsing behavior or patterns
- IP addresses (beyond standard web server logs)
- Cookies for tracking or analytics
- Device information or fingerprints
- Social media profiles or connections
- Payment information (the Service is free)
- Location data

## Information That May Be Collected

### 1. Standard Web Server Logs

Like all web services, standard web server logs may temporarily record:

- IP addresses (for security and troubleshooting)
- Request timestamps
- HTTP request details (URL, user agent, status codes)
- Error logs for debugging

**Retention**: Logs are typically rotated and deleted within 7-30 days unless needed for security investigation.

**Use**: Only used for:
- Security monitoring
- Debugging technical issues
- Preventing abuse or attacks
- System administration

### 2. Technical Information

During your use of the Service, your browser automatically sends:

- Browser type and version
- Operating system
- Referring website (if applicable)
- Pages visited on the Service
- Time and date of access

This information is not used to identify you personally and is only visible in standard server logs.

### 3. API Usage

If you use the Service's API programmatically:

- API requests are processed but not logged by default
- Rate limiting may track request counts temporarily
- Error responses may be logged for debugging

## How We Use Information

The limited technical information we may temporarily collect is used only for:

1. **Service Operation**: Delivering search results and content
2. **Security**: Preventing abuse, attacks, or unauthorized access
3. **Debugging**: Troubleshooting technical issues and errors
4. **Performance**: Optimizing Service speed and reliability

We do NOT use information for:
- Marketing or advertising
- User profiling or tracking
- Sale to third parties
- Cross-site tracking
- Behavioral analysis

## Cookies and Local Storage

### Default Behavior

The Service does NOT use:
- Tracking cookies
- Analytics cookies
- Advertising cookies
- Third-party cookies

### Essential Cookies Only

We may use minimal essential cookies or local storage for:

- Theme preferences (light/dark mode)
- Search interface settings
- Temporary session data

**Control**: You can disable cookies entirely in your browser and the Service will still function (though preferences won't be saved).

## Third-Party Services

### Data Sources

The Service obtains card data from:

1. **Scryfall Bulk Data API**: We download bulk data files from Scryfall. This does not involve sending your search queries to Scryfall.
2. **Card Images**: Images may be served from:
   - Scryfall's image CDN
   - Official Wizards of the Coast servers
   - Our own hosting/CDN

When your browser loads card images, your IP address may be visible to these third-party image servers as part of normal HTTP requests. This is standard web behavior and outside our control.

### Third-Party Privacy Policies

We do not control third-party services. Relevant policies:

- **Scryfall**: https://scryfall.com/privacy
- **Wizards of the Coast**: https://company.wizards.com/en/legal/wizards-coasts-privacy-policy

### No Analytics or Tracking Services

By default, we do NOT use:
- Google Analytics
- Facebook Pixel
- Advertising networks
- Social media widgets
- Third-party tracking scripts

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do NOT sell, rent, trade, or share your information with third parties, except:

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required by:
- Valid legal process (subpoena, court order)
- Law enforcement requests where legally obligated
- Protection of our legal rights or safety of others

### Service Providers

If we use hosting or infrastructure providers, they may have access to server logs as part of their services. We choose providers with strong privacy practices.

## Self-Hosted Deployments

### Your Responsibility

If you deploy your own instance of Scryfall OS:

- **You are the data controller** for your deployment
- **You are responsible** for your own privacy practices
- **You must comply** with applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **You should create** your own privacy policy
- **You must implement** appropriate security measures

### Open Source Nature

Since this is open-source software:

- Anyone can modify the code
- Third-party deployments may have different privacy practices
- We are not responsible for other deployments
- Always verify the privacy policy of the specific instance you're using

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures:

- Secure HTTPS connections
- Regular security updates
- Minimal data collection reduces risk
- No sensitive data storage
- Open-source code allows security review

**However**: No method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

Since we don't collect personal data, there's nothing to retain. However:

- **Server logs**: Automatically deleted after 7-30 days
- **Error logs**: Retained briefly for debugging, then deleted
- **No user data**: No accounts or profiles to delete

## Your Rights

You control:

- Browser privacy features

### Stop Using the Service

You can stop using the Service at any time, and we won't have any data to retain about you.

## Children's Privacy

The Service does not knowingly collect information from anyone, including children under 13. The Service is a general-purpose card database and does not target children specifically.

If we learn we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, we will delete it immediately.

## International Users

The Service may be hosted in [Hosting Location]. If you access the Service from outside this location:

- Your information may be transferred to our servers

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted at this URL with an updated "Last Updated" date.

**Material changes** will be prominently announced.

**Continued use** of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

## Do Not Track Signals

Some browsers support "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals. Since we don't track users by default, DNT signals don't change our behavior—we respect your privacy regardless.
