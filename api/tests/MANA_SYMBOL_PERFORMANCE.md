# Mana Symbol Replacement Performance Optimization

## Summary

The mana symbol replacement logic in `api/index.html` has been optimized from using forEach loops with repeated RegExp creation to using a simple cached regex pattern with map lookup. This resulted in a **45x speedup** (97.8% performance improvement) with significantly lower code complexity.

## Problem

The original implementation had two major performance issues:

1. **Repeated RegExp Creation**: For each mana symbol in the map (70+ symbols), a new RegExp object was created on every function call
2. **Multiple String Replacements**: The `replace()` method was called multiple times (once per symbol), requiring multiple passes through the input string

### Original Implementation (forEach loops)

```javascript
convertManaSymbols(manaCost, isModal = false) {
  // ... manaMap and hybridMap definitions ...
  
  let converted = manaCost;
  
  // Process hybrid symbols first
  Object.keys(hybridMap).forEach(symbol => {
    const regex = new RegExp(symbol.replace(/[{}]/g, '\\$&'), 'g');  // RegExp created 30 times
    converted = converted.replace(regex, ...);  // 30 replace calls
  });
  
  // Process regular mana symbols
  Object.keys(manaMap).forEach(symbol => {
    const regex = new RegExp(symbol.replace(/[{}]/g, '\\$&'), 'g');  // RegExp created 40 times
    converted = converted.replace(regex, ...);  // 40 replace calls
  });
  
  return converted;
}
```

## Solution

The optimized implementation uses a simple, elegant approach:

1. **Simple Regex Pattern**: Uses `/\{[^}]{1,5}\}/g` to match any content between braces (1-5 characters)
2. **Map Lookup**: Checks if the matched symbol exists in the map before replacing
3. **Cached Pattern**: The regex is created once during initialization
4. **Low Complexity**: Much simpler than building a large alternation pattern

### Optimized Implementation (simple pattern with Map lookup)

```javascript
// In constructor:
initManaSymbolPatterns() {
  const manaMap = { /* ... */ };
  const hybridMap = { /* ... */ };
  
  // Simple pattern: match any content between braces (1-5 chars)
  // Use Map for O(1) lookup with single get() operation
  this.manaSymbolsMap = new Map(Object.entries({ ...hybridMap, ...manaMap }));
  this.manaSymbolsRegex = /\{[^}]{1,5}\}/g;
}

// In the method:
convertManaSymbols(manaCost, isModal = false) {
  if (!manaCost) return '';
  
  const symbolClass = isModal ? 'modal-mana-symbol' : 'mana-symbol';
  this.manaSymbolsRegex.lastIndex = 0;
  
  return manaCost.replace(this.manaSymbolsRegex, match => {
    const replacement = this.manaSymbolsMap.get(match);
    if (replacement === undefined) {
      return match; // Return unchanged if not in map
    }
    return `<span class="${symbolClass} ${replacement}"></span>`;
  });
}
```

## Performance Results

Test performed with 10,000 iterations × 14 test cases (140,000 conversions total):

| Implementation | Time (ms) | Speedup |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Old (forEach loops) | 7,246.31 | 1.0x (baseline) |
| New (simple pattern with Map) | 119.37 | **60.70x** |

**Performance Improvement: 98.35%**

### Comparison of Three Approaches

We evaluated three different optimization approaches:

1. **forEach loops** (original): Creates 70+ RegExp objects per call
2. **Cached alternation**: Single regex with all symbols joined (`{W/U/P}|{W/U}|{W}|...`)
3. **Simple pattern with Map** (chosen): Single regex `/\{[^}]{1,5}\}/g` with Map.get() lookup

| Approach | Time (ms) | vs Original | Code Complexity |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| forEach loops | 7,246.31 | baseline | Medium (nested loops) |
| Cached alternation | 142.60 | 50.81x faster | Medium (requires sorting, ~1000 char pattern) |
| **Simple pattern with Map** | **119.37** | **60.70x faster** | **Low (12 char pattern)** |

The simple pattern approach was chosen because:
- **Best performance**: 60.7x faster than original, and 16% faster than alternation
- **Much lower complexity**: 12-character pattern vs 1000+ character pattern
- **Single lookup**: Uses `Map.get()` which returns `undefined` if key doesn't exist, saving one lookup operation
- **More maintainable**: No need to sort symbols or build complex patterns
- **More flexible**: Automatically handles any symbol format without modification

### Test Cases

The test included various mana cost combinations:
- Simple costs: `{W}{U}{B}{R}{G}`
- Repeated symbols: `{1}{R}{R}{R}`
- Variable costs: `{X}{X}{W}{U}`
- Hybrid mana: `{2}{W/U}{B/R}`
- Phyrexian mana: `{3}{W/U/P}{G}`
- Special symbols: `{T}{Q}{E}{P}{S}`
- High costs: `{16}{G}{G}{G}`

## Running the Performance Tests

### Basic Performance Test

To run the basic performance test:

```bash
cd api/tests
node test_mana_symbol_performance.js
```

Expected output:
```
=== Mana Symbol Replacement Test ===

1. Verifying correctness...
✅ All test cases produce identical results

2. Running performance benchmarks...

Results (10000 iterations × 14 test cases):
  Old implementation (forEach): 9503.35ms
  New implementation (single regex): 259.63ms
  Performance improvement: 97.27%
  Speedup: 36.60x faster

✅ All tests passed!
```

### Three-Way Comparison Test

To run the comprehensive comparison of all three approaches:

```bash
cd api/tests
node test_mana_symbol_performance_comparison.js
```

This test compares:
1. Original forEach implementation
2. Cached alternation pattern
3. Simple pattern with map lookup (current implementation)

## Benefits

1. **Faster Page Load**: Reduced CPU time for rendering card mana costs
2. **Better UX**: Smoother scrolling and interactions when displaying many cards
3. **Reduced Energy Usage**: Less CPU cycles means better battery life on mobile devices
4. **Scalability**: Performance improvement is more pronounced with larger card lists

## Implementation Notes

- The regex pattern `/\{[^}]{1,5}\}/g` matches any content between braces with 1-5 characters
- Uses JavaScript `Map` instead of plain objects for O(1) lookup performance
- The `Map.get()` method returns `undefined` if the key doesn't exist, enabling single-lookup optimization
- This saves one lookup operation compared to checking existence and then accessing the value
- If a symbol is not in the map, it's returned unchanged (graceful degradation)
- The `lastIndex` property is reset before each use to ensure the regex with the global flag works correctly
- The same optimization was applied to both `convertManaSymbols()` and `convertManaSymbolsToText()`
- No sorting or complex pattern building is required, making the code simpler and more maintainable
