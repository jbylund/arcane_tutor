There's still the matter of `A AND B AND C` is treated differently than `A AND C AND B`, I wonder if we can order the arguments of N-ary operators, maybe it makes sense to accumulate operands in a set and order them in a reproducible way when we need to convert to something else?

Second I have found in the past it's very convienent to implement the & and | operators so that I can do `node_a & node_b` or `node_c | node_d`


Right now in sql generation we compile right down to a string, but I'd prefer to compile down to
1) a string with parameterized sql
2) the parameters to send along with the query
