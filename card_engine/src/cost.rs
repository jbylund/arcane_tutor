//! Per-plan cost model (#702 step 3b).
//!
//! Parametric cost formulas — one per `PhysicalPlan` — whose constants are FIT
//! to the `plan_cost_calibration` bench (src/tests.rs) measured on the real
//! corpus archive (`benchmarks/verify-order/real.store`: 31508 cards, 97206
//! printings). The routing decision this feeds is `argmin_plan plan_cost`; the
//! objective the constants were fit against is that `argmin` reproduces the
//! empirically-fastest ("gold") plan per query × mode × page depth.
//!
//! `run_query_routed` calls `plan_cost` on every query (it IS the plan selector).
//! It is also validated by the `plan_cost_model_matches_gold` test (src/tests.rs),
//! which computes real `PlanFeatures` (via `prepare_candidates` + `verify_cost_tier`)
//! and checks the model's argmin against re-measured gold.
//!
//! ## Units and provenance
//!
//! Constants are in nanoseconds (or ns per unit of work), fit from the
//! calibration table dated 2026-07-19 on this machine (min-of-60, warmup 5, real
//! corpus). Per the "Keeping costs/plans current" section of
//! docs/issues/00702-engine-plan-selection-layer.md: `argmin` cares about the
//! *ratios* between plans, so a uniform hardware speed change preserves the
//! choice; recalibrate on non-uniform changes (a plan reimplemented, a new index
//! shifting a predicate class, a new plan). Each constant's doc-comment names the
//! data point(s) it was fit from, mirroring `verify_cost_tier`'s provenance style.
//!
//! ## Predicate cost is common-mode
//!
//! The per-card verify tier (`residual_tier_ns100`) is added to BOTH the gather
//! and stream per-card terms, so it largely cancels in their argmin — cardinality
//! and plan structure do the deciding (see #702 "Cost model" §). Popcount (P2)
//! and range-scan (P1) run only when the residual is `True`/absent, so they carry
//! no verify term at all.
//!
//! ## Calibration scope: operating-space via `scan_units` (card + printing)
//!
//! The P3/P4 per-card work was originally fit on CARD mode alone, where the loop
//! breaks at the first matching printing, and it under-predicted printing/artwork
//! P3/P4 by ~`n_printings/n_cards` (≈3.09) because those modes scan EVERY printing
//! of every candidate. The fix is `PlanFeatures::scan_units` (not a `mode` branch):
//! the per-card `card_pass` term is driven by `eval_domain` (candidate cards) and
//! the per-row residual scan + its verify `tier` by `scan_units` (printings under the
//! candidate cards). One mode-agnostic formula, and `scan_units()` no longer branches
//! on mode at all. The `_CARD_PASS`/`_SCAN` split of the old lumped
//! `VISIT` constants was fit to hold card unchanged while correcting printing (see
//! each constant's doc). Artwork rides the printing path (same all-printings scan);
//! its confirming validation is still pending a bench run.
//!
//! A 1200-query designed refit (`plan_cost_refit`, weighted LSQ, 70/30 train/test)
//! VALIDATED rather than beat these: P1's fitted STEP=4.14 ≈ 4.5 (test 1.38× ≈
//! train); P3/P4 could NOT be fit — `SCAN` goes negative because `scan_units` and
//! `matches` both scale with printing count in the workload, a STRUCTURAL
//! collinearity no corpus size fixes (P2 stays data-starved: pure-plane queries are
//! rare). The `_CARD_PASS`/`_SCAN`/`PUSH` split is a physical prior resolving what
//! data alone cannot. Model sits at ~1.4× absolute (slow bucket), ordering-correct
//! (argmin==gold 87/88) — the identifiable ceiling for this workload.
//!
//! ## What the span counter could and could not show (2026-08-02)
//!
//! The paragraph above used to justify the mode-agnostic `scan_units` by asserting that "the
//! `printings_scanned` counter shows the scan plans walk the full printing span of their candidates in
//! CARD mode too, not one row each". That inference does not hold, and the sentence is now deleted
//! rather than merely qualified: the counter (since renamed `printing_span`) was computed by the
//! CALLER as `end - start` per surviving card, before the match kernel ran, so it reported the span
//! whatever the kernel then did. It could not distinguish the two cases it was being cited for.
//!
//! The kernels do stop early in card mode. `card_match_count` returns from `all_match` without reading
//! a printing at all, and both it and `push_card_matches` return at the FIRST qualifying printing
//! under `Prefer::Default`. `printings_examined`, reported by the kernels themselves, is the quantity
//! `scan_units` predicts, and grading against it is what `bench_feature_accuracy.py` now does.
//!
//! The mode-agnostic span estimate nonetheless survives that correction, for a reason the original
//! note did not give: under an INEXACT narrowing most candidate cards do not match, and a
//! non-matching card is ruled out only after its whole span is walked. So the span is a good proxy in
//! card mode generally (`scan_units [candidates] / card` grades p50 1.00 against `printings_examined`)
//! and wrong specifically where the narrowing is EXACT — the plane acquire, where `all_match` holds
//! and `prefer` then decides everything. That case is handled in `acquire_plan_features`.
