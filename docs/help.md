# Arcane Tutor - User Help Guide

## Quick Start

Arcane Tutor is a powerful Magic: The Gathering card search engine. This guide will help you find exactly the cards you're looking for.

## Basic Searches

### Search by Card Name

Simply type the card name in the search box:
```
Lightning Bolt
```

For partial matches, just type part of the name:
```
bolt
```

### Search by Type

Use `type:` or `t:` to find cards by their type:
```
type:Dragon
t:Planeswalker
t:instant
```

### Search by Color

Use `color:` or `c:` to find cards by color:
```
c:red
c:UR       (blue and red)
c:WUG      (white, blue, and green)
```

Use `id:` or `identity:` for color identity (includes mana symbols in text):
```
id:WU      (white/blue identity)
```

## Advanced Searches

### Numeric Comparisons

Search by mana cost, power, toughness, or loyalty using comparison operators:
```
cmc=3                    (converted mana cost exactly 3)
cmc<=2                   (2 or less mana)
power>=5                 (power 5 or greater)
toughness<3              (toughness less than 3)
loyalty>4                (loyalty greater than 4)
```

### Text Searches

Search within oracle text (rules text) or flavor text:
```
oracle:flying
o:"draw a card"          (exact phrase)
flavor:brother
```

### Rarity and Sets

Filter by rarity or specific sets:
```
rarity:mythic
r>=rare                  (rare or mythic)
set:MH2                  (Modern Horizons 2)
```

### Price Searches

Find cards within your budget:
```
usd<5                    (less than $5)
usd>=10                  (at least $10)
eur<2                    (less than €2)
```

## Combining Searches

Use `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine searches:
```
type:Dragon AND color:red
c:R OR c:G
type:instant NOT color:blue
```

Use parentheses for complex queries:
```
(type:instant OR type:sorcery) AND cmc<=2
```

## Common Search Patterns

### Budget Commander Creatures
```
type:legendary type:creature usd<5 identity:WU
```

### Efficient Removal Spells
```
(type:instant OR type:sorcery) oracle:destroy oracle:creature cmc<=3
```

### Card Draw in Blue
```
color:blue oracle:"draw" (type:instant OR type:sorcery)
```

### Mana Dorks (Mana Producing Creatures)
```
type:creature produces:any cmc<=2
```

### High Power Creatures
```
type:creature power>=8 cmc<=6
```

## Special Features

### Regular Expressions

Use `/pattern/` for regex searches:
```
name:/^Lightning/        (names starting with "Lightning")
```

### Arithmetic Expressions

Arcane Tutor supports math in queries (unique feature!):
```
cmc+1<power              (undercosted creatures)
power-toughness=0        (square creatures)
power+toughness>10       (total stats greater than 10)
```

### Format Legality

Search by format legality:
```
format:modern
legal:commander
banned:standard
```

### Keywords

Search for specific keyword abilities:
```
keyword:flying
keyword:vigilance
k:trample
```

## Tips for Better Searches

1. **Use quotes** for exact phrases: `oracle:"draw three cards"`
2. **Combine filters** to narrow results: `type:creature c:red cmc<=3 power>=2`
3. **Use negation** to exclude cards: `type:creature NOT color:black`
4. **Try shortcuts**: Use `t:` instead of `type:`, `c:` instead of `color:`
5. **Experiment with operators**: `>=`, `<=`, `!=` all work for numeric searches

## Sorting Results

Use the dropdown menus to sort your results:
- **Order By**: Choose what to sort by (EDHREC, CMC, Power, Rarity, Price)
- **Direction**: Toggle ascending/descending with the arrow button
- **Unique Mode**: Choose between unique cards, artwork, or printings
- **Prefer**: Select which printing to show (oldest, newest, cheapest, etc.)
