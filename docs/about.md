# About Arcane Tutor

## Project Mission

Arcane Tutor is an open-source Magic: The Gathering card search engine designed to provide a fast, powerful, and transparent alternative for the MTG community. Our goal is to create a feature-rich search tool that respects intellectual property rights while offering unique capabilities and complete openness.

## Why Arcane Tutor Exists

### Open Source Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Transparency**: All code is open and available for review
- **Community ownership**: Anyone can contribute, fork, or self-host
- **Educational value**: Learn how card search engines work
- **Data sovereignty**: Run your own instance with your own data

### Unique Features

Arcane Tutor offers capabilities beyond traditional card search:

1. **Arithmetic Expressions**: Search with math like `cmc+1<power` or `power-toughness=0`
2. **No Pagination Limits**: Fetch more results than typical 175 card/page limits
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Custom PostgreSQL schema for fast queries
4. **Local Deployment**: Run your own instance via Docker
5. **Extensibility**: Open source means you can add your own features

### Alternative Implementation

While we use Scryfall's excellent card data (with attribution and compliance), Arcane Tutor is a completely independent implementation:
- All code written from scratch
- Original query parser and search algorithms
- Custom database schema
- Different UI/UX approach
- Unique feature set

## How We Differ from Scryfall

Arcane Tutor is not a clone of Scryfall. Here's how we're different:

### Technical Differences
- **Original Codebase**: 100% original code, no copied implementation
- **Independent Database**: Custom PostgreSQL schema optimized for our use cases
- **Different Architecture**: Falcon-based API with bjoern WSGI server
- **Unique Parser**: Custom pyparsing-based query DSL implementation
- **Extended Features**: Arithmetic expressions and other unique capabilities

### Visual Design
- **Different Color Scheme**: Blue gradient theme (Tolarian Academy inspired)
- **Original Layout**: Custom card grid and modal display
- **Unique UI Components**: Original search controls and dropdowns
- **Different Typography**: Custom font choices (Beleren, MPlantin)

### Philosophy
- **Open Source First**: Complete transparency and community ownership
- **Self-Hostable**: Run your own instance with Docker
- **No Limits**: Designed for power users who need more data
- **Extensible**: Fork and customize for your needs

## Technology Stack

See [README.md](../README.md#code-organization) for detailed information about:
- Backend architecture (Python, Falcon, bjoern)
- Database design (PostgreSQL with optimized schema)
- Frontend implementation
- Deployment options (Docker)
