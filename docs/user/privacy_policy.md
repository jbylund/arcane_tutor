## 5. Third-Party Services

### 5.1 Data Sources

We retrieve card data from **Scryfall's bulk data API**.
When you use our Service:

- [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com) - Magic: The Gathering owner
- [GitHub](https://github.com/jbylund/arcane_tutor) - Source code repository

These sites have their own privacy policies.
We are not responsible for their practices.

### 5.3 CDN and Font Services

We may use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve:

- Card images
- Font files (Mana symbols, Beleren, MPlantin)

## 6. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the Service, but:

- We cannot guarantee absolute security
- You use the Service at your own risk

Since we don't collect personal information, there is minimal risk of data breach affecting users.

The Service does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
The Service is not directed at children, and we do not market to children.

### 8.1 Theme Preference

You can:
- Clear your theme preference by clearing browser local storage
- Toggle between light and dark themes using the theme button

If you have concerns, you can:

- Clear your browser's local storage

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect:

- Changes to the Service
- Legal or regulatory requirements

Changes will be effective immediately upon posting.
We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.

Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
