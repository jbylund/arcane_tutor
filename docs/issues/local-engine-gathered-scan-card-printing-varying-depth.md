# GatheredScan/card: Printing-Varying Leaf Scan Depth

Extracted from item 1 of
[local-engine-cost-model-cleanup-remaining.md](local-engine-cost-model-cleanup-remaining.md) once it
became an ongoing iteration ledger rather than a single-pass fix. Base branch for all work here is
`engine-cost-model-cleanup`, never `main`.

## Problem

**Population**: `GatheredScan`/`unique=card` is the worst-agreement, highest-frequency cell in the
whole cost model — by frequency alone it dominates routing regret more than any other cell.

**What we already know**: the shape-level breakdown (bucketing `printing_compose`/card-mode queries by
AST shape) found `and-2` and `and-3` — specifically pairs/triples over printing-varying fields
(`price_eur`, `price_usd`, `price_tix`, `collector_number_int`, `released_at`, and mixed pairs like
`card_color_identity + price_tix`) — carrying the bulk of the remaining magnitude-weighted error
(tens of millions of units each, at investigation time). These don't qualify for the prior session's
card-invariant depth-1 fix: a printing-varying field has no "first printing settles it" guarantee (a
card matching `price_usd<5` can have OTHER printings that don't), so they still fall through the flat
`domain_cards * printings_per_card * COMPOSE_CANDIDATE_SPAN_BIAS` fallback in the `scan_all` closure
(`card_engine/src/lib.rs:11616`; constant at `:11041`, currently 2.1) — and that formula prices every
card as if it needed its *average* reprint history walked, regardless of how selective the predicate
actually is at the printing level.

Two starting-point ideas, either or both may end up in the ledger below:

1. **Match-density depth proxy.** The query's own printing-level match density (`matches /
   domain_cards` — average number of matching printings per matching card) is a much better proxy for
   expected scan depth than the corpus-wide `printings_per_card` average. A per-card-first-match
   expectation, using order statistics on the position of the first match among a card's printings, is
   the natural model: `expected_depth ≈ (avg_printings_per_card + 1) / (avg_matches_per_matching_card +
   1)`, capped at the card's own span. `COMPOSE_CANDIDATE_SPAN_BIAS` was fit against the OLD flat-average
   shape and should be re-derived (likely much closer to `1.0`) once the depth term itself carries real
   selectivity information, not stacked on top of the new term unchanged.
2. **Per-leaf independence-product combination.** A generalization of (1) to multiple printing-varying
   leaves at once: combine each leaf's own printing-level selectivity via an independence product
   (with a fudge factor) rather than a single aggregate depth term — see Constraints below for why this
   needs an explicit correlation guard before it can be trusted.

## Constraints

- **Pre-computation over hot-path computation, hard requirement.** This repo has a specific, measured
  precedent for what goes wrong otherwise: relaxing `compose_printing_estimate`'s `best_other`
  intersection threshold from `>=2` to `==1` closed a logical gap but caused a **23.6x acquire-time
  regression** (875ns → 20,646ns median) on the newly-admitted population, because it added an
  unconditional `eval_planes`/`popcount_with_bits` pass paid by every query in that population
  regardless of whether the tightening ever changed the routing decision. Reverted; see
  [local-engine-cost-model-cleanup-remaining.md](local-engine-cost-model-cleanup-remaining.md)'s
  "Explicitly considered and rejected" section for the full account — link, don't restate it. Any new
  idea here must trace every new number to an existing precomputed index/table/constant, not a new
  per-query scan whose cost grows with match/printing/candidate count.
- **Price-triple correlation risk.** `price_usd`, `price_eur`, and `price_tix` are near-identical market
  values expressed in different currencies/units — they are NOT independent. An independence-product
  combination across this triple (or any pair of them) will badly underestimate the true joint count.
  Any independence-style idea must be explicitly tested against this triple before being trusted, not
  just against `collector_number_int`/`released_at`-shaped queries. (Power/toughness correlation is
  already handled exactly elsewhere via `arith_tuple_count` — not a risk in this population, no need to
  re-verify it here.)
- **Out of scope, hard**: `card_engine/src/estimator.rs` (its `estimate_cardinality` is live at
  `lib.rs:11146` behind the `STREAM_MIN_MATCHES` gate — editing it can move a shipped routing decision,
  and its `compose_and` independence estimator is unwired PR1 of #702, validated for soundness only).
  Items 2-4 of the parent punch-list doc. `Mode::Printing`/`Mode::Artwork`. Anything outside `lib.rs`,
  `cost.rs`, `tests.rs`, and this doc.

## Current best

As of Round 0 (baseline, `engine-cost-model-cleanup` @ `97dc30c8`), nothing from this doc has shipped
yet — the fix is still the flat fallback described above. Baseline measured against an isolated release
build (`maturin build --release`, extracted wheel, `PYTHONPATH`-pinned — never `maturin develop` into
the shared `.venv`, which silently redirects every other session's `import card_engine`):

```
GatheredScan   card   n=35,074   median 0.67   p10 0.25   p90 2.75   16% within 25%   FAIL
```
(`.venv/bin/python scripts/bench_cost_model_agreement.py --seconds 300 --seed 0`, run from a
`costcell/00-baseline` worktree branched off `engine-cost-model-cleanup`.)

## Confirmation runs

(None yet — populated only for rounds that reach a keeper: `bench_regret_matrix.py` +
`bench_query_latency_ab.py` results, before cherry-picking onto `engine-cost-model-cleanup`.)
