# N-Way Estimator Follow-Up Queue

Tracks what's left from the `And`-arm cardinality-estimation arc (Rounds 33-52), in the order we
intend to tackle it. This doc is the queue, not the depth — the round-by-round numbers live in
[local-engine-gathered-scan-card-printing-varying-depth.md](local-engine-gathered-scan-card-printing-varying-depth.md),
and the architecture/design rationale lives in
[local-engine-nway-compose-independence-search.md](local-engine-nway-compose-independence-search.md).
Update this doc as items get picked up or finished — move a finished item to "Completed" with a
one-line pointer to the round that shipped it, don't duplicate its details here.

## Active queue (in order)

1. **Generalize "anchored independence" further.** Round 50 shipped this deliberately narrow: only
   `SubtypeArithBox`'s own hit, only a single residual `IndepClass::Price` leaf. Three separate
   directions remain, each its own future round (validate independently, don't bundle):
   - **More residual classes.** Only `Price` has a validated real-data example; other classes
     (`ColorId`, `Cmc`, `Type`, etc., wherever `SubtypeArithBox`'s own residual isn't itself the arith
     dimension) need their own before/after check before being added, mirroring how
     `independence_safe_pair`'s own registry grew one validated class at a time (Round 38 → Round 40).
   - **More anchor mechanisms.** `SubtypePairIndexes`/`ColorCmcTable`'s own exact hits are the same
     shape (an exact joint, blind to whatever residual leaves remain) and would plausibly benefit the
     same way — not attempted, no validated example yet for either.
   - **Combining multiple safe residual classes into one product**, not just one — needs the same
     order-statistics-bias care already documented in the design doc (never try residuals separately
     and pick the smallest) once 2+ classes are each independently validated as safe to anchor.
2. **Measure the residual-size distribution for real 5+-leaf queries.** Still unmeasured since before
   this session started. This is the actual answer to "is the general bounded partition search worth
   building at all" — if real residuals rarely exceed 2-3 leaves, the "notice one bad case, build one
   validated mechanism" pattern (8 real gaps closed this way so far: Rounds 34, 40, 42, 44, 45, 48, 51,
   52) may just *be* the right architecture, not a placeholder for a general one.
3. **Decide on / scope the actual general bounded partition search**, informed by #2's findings and
   built on Round 49's own subset-tracking primitive (`CoveredState`'s `subsets: Vec<u64>`, already
   shipped). Not attempted until the above are in.

## Lower priority, no urgency

- **`SubtypeArithBox`'s own top-N cutoff harmonized to "include all ties.**" It already has a correct
  deterministic tiebreak (unlike the bug Round 47 fixed elsewhere) — converting it to the same
  no-arbitrary-exclusion philosophy is a reasonable style-consistency idea, not a bug fix.
- **Audit `lib.rs:6307`** (query-planning candidate ranking, sorts by `(rank, sort_k)`) for the same
  class of tie-order-affects-outcome property Round 47 fixed in `build_subtype_pair_tables`. Flagged,
  never confirmed either way.
- **The Round 43 "swept trio"** (`legality`/`color`/`identity`×`price` — worse than either component's
  own baseline via `PlanePopcount` plus a plain-min-folded price leaf, not the double-independence
  question Round 44 fixed) and the two smaller, less-confirmed stars (`identity+pow+set`,
  `cmc+type+usd`). Real, small, not urgent absent evidence they matter for real routing regret.

## Standing principles for anything built here

- **Exact/bound-class candidates need no placement or reservation logic at all** — `.min()`-folding
  any number of them, in any order, over any overlapping subsets, is always sound (Round 42).
- **Estimate-class candidates may only fill a gap no exact mechanism covers for that exact subset,
  never compete by magnitude with one** (Round 40).
- **Multiple estimate-class candidates for the identical target must never be selected by magnitude**
  — picking the smallest of several noisy estimates of one quantity is a real, systematic
  undercounting bias (order-statistics selection bias), not mere looseness. See
  [local-engine-nway-compose-independence-search.md](local-engine-nway-compose-independence-search.md)'s
  own point 4 under "Three things naive strategies get wrong" for the full argument.

## Completed

- Round 42: `SubtypePairIndexes` generalized past its `v.len() == 2` gate.
- Round 44: exact `(colors|identity) x cmc` table, closing the confirmed-bad independence star.
- Round 45: `set:X`'s own card/artwork floor populated.
- Round 46: `fold_candidate`/`Candidate` structural refactor + the `debug_assert` census.
- Round 47: deterministic top-N (include-all-ties) for `build_subtype_pair_tables`.
- Round 48: `SubtypeArithBox` generalized past its whole-query-shape gate to scan the residual.
- Round 49: `covered` loosened from leaf-occupancy to subset-identity tracking (`CoveredState`) for the
  independence registry — recovers Round 48's own regression and improves the sweep overall.
- Round 50: "anchored independence" for `SubtypeArithBox` — exact joint × single residual `Price` rate,
  narrowly scoped (see item #1 above for what's left to generalize).
- Round 51: exact `arith_tuple` (printing, card, artwork) triples, precomputed at build time
  (`ArithTupleIndex.totals`) — closes Round 46's census gap; surfaced the `unique=artwork` acquire-path
  gap, closed by Round 52.
- Round 52: `est.result.card`/`.artwork` wired into `unique=card`/`unique=artwork`'s own acquire path as
  an additional `.min()` tightening (never a replacement for the calibrated baseline — a real 170x
  regression in the first attempt was caught by the corpus sweep before shipping and is now a dedicated
  regression test). Closes Round 51's own `unique=artwork` gap.
- Harness fix (no round number, a Python-only fix outside the engine): `client/query_sampler.py`'s
  `_count_row` folded oracle/flavor words via `Counter.update(set(...))` — bare-set iteration is
  hash-seed-randomized per process, so tied-frequency co-occurring words could swap `most_common()`'s
  tie-break across runs. Fixed with `sorted(set(...))`; verified byte-identical output across 5 fresh
  process runs (was 20-32 line diffs before), plus a subprocess-based regression test that fails on the
  pre-fix code and passes after.
